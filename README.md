# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Correctly

This repository demonstrates a bug where certain Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to an element, specifically the hover effect not working as expected.

## Description
A simple div element with Tailwind CSS classes (`bg-red-500`, `hover:bg-blue-700`, `p-4`, `rounded`) is used.  The `hover:bg-blue-700` class, intended to change the background color on hover, does not function.

## Steps to reproduce:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run a development server (e.g., using Vite, Webpack, or a similar tool).
3. Observe that the hover effect does not work on the div.

## Solution
The solution might involve several factors: ensuring that Tailwind's directives are correctly set up, checking for conflicts with other CSS, making sure the correct version of Tailwind is used, or that the javascript framework is being properly used. See `bugSolution.js` for more information.
